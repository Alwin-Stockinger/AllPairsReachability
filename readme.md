# Partitioned Dynamic All Pairs Reachability Algorithms

This program was part of a bachelor thesis on "Dynamic All-Pairs Reachability on Partitioned Graphs".

### Prerequisites

Algora: The program is heavily based on the Algora graph library\
KaHIP: The partitioned algorithms use KaHIP to partition the graph

## Built With

CMake
